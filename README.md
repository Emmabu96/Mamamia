# Mamamia
The fire repository of a starter
I made a lightly change to this readme-edits to make it different from the master mamamia.
I want to learn Excel, SQL. Because it's a strong and valueable skill generally used in careers
I want to learn about Pyhthon data analyses methodology. I think it can help me go further on my career road
I want to have a look on the machine learning. Needless to say the interesting to have a deep look on both machine and human brains, the thinking process along is fascinating.
I want to learn the programming. It will be hard, but I want to see how far can I go on my own.
